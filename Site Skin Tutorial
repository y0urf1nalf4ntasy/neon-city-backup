How to use Site Skins on AO3 dot org!

Hey hi and hello! First of all, thank you so much for using my skin! I really hope it makes your reading experience
enjoyable!

To use an AO3 skin, start off by going to your dashboard on AO3. From there, click "skins", which will bring you to all
the site skins you've saved if you've done this before. Next, click on "create site skin" then come back here to github.

Grab all the bits of this skin you want to use, and copy-paste them into the big box one at a time. Once things are
pasted in there, give your skin a name and description. Since the name has to be unique even if you're not making
your skin public, just keysmash. You can leave everything else blank, everything other than the name and the code is
for anyone looking to make their skin public.

Before you click submit, make sure to preview the skin first to make sure it's to your liking! If you're satisfyed,
click to big old "return to site to use" button. You'll never guess why.

That's it! Go forth and use this skin to read or write the most self indulgent thing you can find! Thank you again
for using it!
